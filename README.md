# qToolbar

qToolbar is an application to handle and manage your desktop shortcuts, or even files. The aim is for a cleaner desktop experience.

Simply drag a shortcut or file from your desktop(or elsewhere) onto qToolbar. If it is a shortcut, the file will be deleted and pulled into qToolbar. If it's a file, the file will be relocated to the "files" sub-directory where qToolbar resides.
